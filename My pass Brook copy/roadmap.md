# MyPass Project Roadmap

**Project Summary**

"MyPass" is a web-based password management software built with Flask. The application allows users to securely manage their sensitive data with features including:

- **Account Registration**: Users can sign up using their email as the username, set a master password, and provide answers to three security questions.
- **User Authentication**: Users log in with their email and master password, followed by answering a security question for added security.
- **Password Vault**: Authenticated users can access a vault to store and manage sensitive data such as logins, credit cards, identities, and secure notes.
- **Password Generator**: Includes a tool to generate strong passwords based on user-specified criteria.
- **Security Features**:
  - **Weak Password Warning**: Alerts users if their master password is considered weak.
  - **Data Masking**: Sensitive data is masked by default and can be unmasked temporarily.
  - **Auto-Lock and Clipboard Management**: Application auto-locks after inactivity and clears clipboard data after use.
- **Design Patterns Implemented**:
  - **Singleton**: Manages user sessions securely.
  - **Observer**: Notifies users about security events like weak passwords or expiring documents.
  - **Mediator**: Manages communication between UI components.
  - **Builder**: Generates complex passwords with specific requirements.
  - **Proxy**: Handles masking and unmasking of sensitive data.
  - **Chain of Responsibility**: Facilitates master password recovery through security questions.

## Project Roadmap

The project is divided into phases to systematically develop and implement all required features and design patterns.

### **Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Functionality**

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up a virtual environment and initialize a Git repository.
   - Install required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install Flask Flask-Login Flask-WTF Flask-SQLAlchemy
     ```

2. **Basic Application Structure**
   - Create the project directory structure:
     ```
     MyPass/
     ├── app.py
     ├── config.py
     ├── models.py
     ├── forms.py
     ├── templates/
     ├── static/
     ├── utilities/
     ├── tests/
     └── requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Database Setup**
   - Configure SQLAlchemy in `app.py`.
   - Define the `User` model in `models.py` with fields for email, password hash, security questions, and answers.
   - Initialize the database and create tables.

4. **User Registration**
   - Implement the registration route in `app.py`.
   - Create `RegistrationForm` in `forms.py`.
   - Develop `register.html` template in `templates/`.
   - Hash passwords and securely store security answers.

5. **User Login**
   - Implement the login route.
   - Create `LoginForm`.
   - Develop `login.html` template.
   - Validate credentials using Flask-Login.

6. **Security Question Verification**
   - Create a route for security question verification.
   - Update `SecurityQuestionForm` to display dynamic questions.
   - Ensure users answer correctly before accessing the vault.

7. **Dashboard Access**
   - Implement `dashboard.html` template.
   - Protect the dashboard route with `@login_required`.

---

### **Phase 2: Vault and Data Management**

8. **Vault Structure**
   - Define models for data types: `Login`, `CreditCard`, `Identity`, `SecureNote`.
   - Establish relationships between `User` and these models.

9. **CRUD Operations**
   - Implement create, read, update, and delete functionalities for vault items.
   - Create forms and templates for each operation.

10. **Data Masking**
    - Use the Proxy pattern to mask sensitive data.
    - Allow users to unmask data temporarily with proper checks.

11. **Copy to Clipboard**
    - Enable copying of data like passwords and credit card details.
    - Implement auto-clear functionality for the clipboard.

12. **Password Generator**
    - Develop a password generator using the Builder pattern.
    - Allow customization of password criteria.

---

### **Phase 3: Security Enhancements**

13. **Weak Password Warning**
    - Implement a password strength checker during registration.
    - Provide feedback and suggestions for stronger passwords.

14. **Auto-Lock Feature**
    - Set up session timeout to auto-lock after inactivity.

15. **Observer Pattern Implementation**
    - Monitor events like password strength and document expiration.
    - Notify users accordingly.

16. **Master Password Recovery**
    - Implement the Chain of Responsibility pattern for password recovery.
    - Use security questions to verify identity.

---

### **Phase 4: User Interface and Experience**

17. **UI Enhancements**
    - Apply the Mediator pattern for UI component communication.
    - Improve templates with CSS and possibly integrate Bootstrap.

18. **Responsive Design**
    - Ensure the application is mobile-friendly and responsive.

19. **User Feedback and Notifications**
    - Implement flash messages for user actions.
    - Provide notifications for security alerts.

---

### **Phase 5: Testing and Documentation**

20. **Automated Testing**
    - Write unit tests for all features using `unittest` or `pytest`.
    - Cover user authentication, data management, and security features.

21. **Code Documentation**
    - Add docstrings and comments throughout the codebase.
    - Maintain a high level of code readability.

22. **Project Report**
    - Prepare documentation including:
      - Class diagrams illustrating design patterns.
      - Database schema and explanations.
      - Screenshots of the user interface.
      - References and resources used.

---

### **Phase 6: Finalization and Deployment**

23. **Security Audit**
    - Review code for vulnerabilities.
    - Ensure compliance with security best practices.

24. **Deployment Preparation**
    - Configure the app for production deployment.
    - Update settings for a production environment.

25. **Testing in Production Environment**
    - Deploy to a test server.
    - Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing.

---

**Additional Notes**

- **Version Control**
  - Use Git for version control with clear commit messages.
  - Employ branching strategies for feature development.

- **Project Requirements**
  - Regularly consult project guidelines to ensure all requirements are met.

- **Time Management**
  - Allocate time for each phase based on project deadlines.
  - Adjust the roadmap as necessary to stay on schedule.
